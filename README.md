# InkScapeBoxMaker
This is an inkscape extension to support various Laser Cut Box Layouts

Currently it supports three types of boxes
 - just an open box (with bottom, left, right, front, and back side, but no top cover)
 - a box with a top cover that can be opened by a hinge
 - a shelf box with inner boxes
 
Additionally there is a highly experimental version that for a box with a mobile loader stand. This is still unfinished, and does not yet meet my standards for usability and elegance :-( )
